<h2>Chat GPT Integration with Command Line</h2>

*This is a Python program that integrates OpenAI's Chat GPT model with the command line interface, allowing you to interact with the model and execute commands from the terminal.*
Usage

   1. Clone the repository or download the code files.

   2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
        
          pip install -r requirements.txt

   3. Obtain an OpenAI API key and replace "YOUR_OPENAI_API_HERE" in the code with your actual API key.

   4. Run the program using the following command:

          python chat_gpt_cli.py

   5. The program will start in the command line interface. You can enter commands, chat with the Chat GPT model, and receive responses.

   6. To execute commands, simply enter them in the command line. The program will execute the command and display the output.

   7. To chat with the Chat GPT model, enter your message or question. The program will send the message to the model, receive a response, and display it.

   8. You can navigate through command history using the arrow keys (up and down) to retrieve previous or next commands.

   9. To quit the program, enter "quit" or "exit" in the command line.

Example Commands

   To change the directory, use the cd command followed by the desired directory path.

    cd /path/to/directory

   To execute system commands, simply enter them in the command line.

    ls -l

   To chat with the Chat GPT model, enter your message or question.
